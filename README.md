Sports Booking App

Introduction
The Sports Booking App is a web application designed to streamline the process of booking sports facilities for students in a college setting. It allows users to register, login, and book various sports facilities at their convenience. The primary objective of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, efficient system for managing sports bookings.

Design Decisions
User-Friendly Interface: The frontend was designed to be intuitive, allowing users to navigate through the booking process seamlessly.
Separation of Concerns: The project follows a clear separation between frontend and backend, making it easier to maintain and scale.
Authentication: A secure login and registration system was implemented to ensure only authorized users can book facilities.
Real-time Updates: Real-time booking updates were implemented to prevent double bookings and ensure accuracy.
Implementation Details
Backend Setup
The backend of the application was developed using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database.

Steps to Setup Backend:
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file for configuration:

Add your MongoDB URI and any other necessary environment variables.
Example:
env
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sports_booking
PORT=5000
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Frontend Setup
The frontend was built using React.js for a dynamic and responsive user experience.

Steps to Setup Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Challenges and Solutions
Database Connectivity: Initially, there were some issues connecting to the MongoDB database. This was resolved by adjusting the connection URI in the .env file.
Booking Conflicts: Handling multiple users trying to book the same facility at the same time posed a challenge. This was addressed by implementing real-time booking updates and adding checks to prevent double bookings.
Future Improvements
Mobile App: Developing a mobile version of the app for easier access on the go.
Notification System: Implementing an email or SMS notification system to remind users of their bookings.
More Sports Facilities: Adding more options for different types of sports and facilities as needed.
