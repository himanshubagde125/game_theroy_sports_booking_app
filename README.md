## **Implementaion details**
The Sports Booking App was built using a modern, full-stack JavaScript framework to ensure a responsive and efficient experience for users. The following technologies were chosen for their flexibility and scalability:

- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML/CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the user interface, ensuring a clean and responsive design across different devices.
  - **React:** A powerful JavaScript library used for building the dynamic and interactive user interface. React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which makes the app scalable and easy to maintain.

- **Backend:**
  - **Express.js:** A lightweight and flexible web application framework for Node.js, used to handle server-side logic, routes, and API requests. Express provides the foundation for building a fast and scalable backend.
  - **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used to store user profiles, venue data, and booking information. MongoDB's flexible schema design is ideal for handling the dynamic nature of the app's data, allowing efficient query and update operations.

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language used on both the frontend and backend, ensuring seamless communication between the client and server.

This tech stack was chosen to provide a smooth, user-friendly experience while maintaining flexibility and scalability for future enhancements.
